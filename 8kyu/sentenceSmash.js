// Sentence Smash
// Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

// Example
// ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']  =>  'hello world this is great'


//Pass in an array of words
//Return a string, each work put together in a sentence w/ spaces
//['Ogres', 'are', 'like', 'onions'] -> 'Ogres are like onions'

//Join the array with spaces inbetween using an array method

// const smash = words => words.join(' ');
