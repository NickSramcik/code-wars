// Implement a function called multiply, which takes two numbers and returns their product:

// multiply(2, 3) = 6
// multiply(0, 188) = 0
// multiply(85, 144) = 12240

// Pass in 2 numbers
// Return their products
// (6, 9) -> 54
// Multiply the inputs and return

const multiply = (n1, n2) => n1 * n2;

// One line functions don't have to be constants

let multiply = (a, b) => a*b;

// Probably not a good idea to do this though, in case something changes the function by mistake
