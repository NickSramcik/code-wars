// You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

// Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

// Example 1:

// Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
// Output: 3
// Example 2:

// Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
// Output: 0
 
// Constraints:

// 1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
// jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
// All the characters of jewels are unique.

// Pass in 2 strings, jewels and stones â€” former representing which letters are jewels
// Return how many characters in the stones string are 'jewels'
// 'sh', 'shrek is an ogre' -> 3
